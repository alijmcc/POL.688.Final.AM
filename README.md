Everything you need to reproduce the project is available in this Github repository. 

First the DATA folder has both of the .csv files I worked with. There are two different datasets to reflect the 2 different years of tweets I analyzed: 
28k #MeToo tweets from October 2017, and 
15k #MeToo tweets from October 2019. 

From there the CODE files include the two different R scripts I used-- again two different ones as I am utilizing two different datasets for this project. It is full of comments to act as a guide for reproducibility and to help understand the actions that I took for the text analyses. 

Lastly, the folder named RESULTS has all of the visuals that I created in R as JPEGs so you can view the main results without having to open the R script. 

Thanks :)
